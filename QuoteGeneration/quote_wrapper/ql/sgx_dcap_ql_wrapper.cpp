 * (persistent).  This better ensures that the enclaves will be available upon quote requests and not subject to EPC 
 * limitations if loaded on demand. However, if the Quoting library is linked with an application process, there may be 
 * many applications with the Quoting library and a better utilization of EPC is to load and unloaded the quoting
 * enclaves on demand (ephemeral).  The library will be shipped with a default policy of loading enclaves and leaving
 * them loaded until the library is unloaded (PERSISTENT). If the policy is set to EPHEMERAL, then the QE and PCE will
 * be loaded and unloaded on-demand.  If either enclave is already loaded when the policy is change to EPHEMERAL, the 
 * enclaves will be unloaded before returning. 
 *  
 * @param policy Sets the requested enclave loading policy to either SGX_QL_PERSISTENT, SGX_QL_EPHEMERAL or
