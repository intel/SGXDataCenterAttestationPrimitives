  // The local cache files will be sequentially searched in the following directories until located in one of them:
  // Linux : $AZDCAP_CACHE, $XDG_CACHE_HOME, $HOME, $TMPDIR, /tmp/
  // Windows : $AZDCAP_CACHE, $LOCALAPPDATA\..\..\LocalLow

  // not the account used to log in. For instance, if QPL is loaded by QGS, then those environment variables relate to
  // the "qgsd" account, which is the account that runs the QGS daemon.
  // You can remove the local cache files either manually or by using the QPL API, sgx_qpl_clear_cache. If you opt to
  // delete them manually, navigate to the aforementioned caching directories, find the folder named .dcap-qcnl, and delete it.

  // To ensure that the PCK cache is available for use, an administrator must pre-populate the cache folders with 
  // the appropriate cache files. To generate these cache files for specific platforms, the administrator can use 
  // the PCCS admin tool. Once the cache files are generated, the administrator must distribute them to each platform 
  // that requires provisioning.
