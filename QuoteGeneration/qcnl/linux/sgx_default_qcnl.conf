  // If you use a PCCS service to get the quote verification collateral, you can specify which PCCS API version is to be used.
  // The legacy 3.0 API will return CRLs in HEX encoded DER format and the sgx_ql_qve_collateral_t.version will be set to 3.0, while
  // the new 3.1 API will return raw DER format and the sgx_ql_qve_collateral_t.version will be set to 3.1. The pccs_api_version 
  // setting is ignored if collateral_service is set to the Intel PCS. In this case, the pccs_api_version is forced to be 3.1 
  // internally.  Currently, only values of 3.0 and 3.1 are valid.  Note, if you set this to 3.1, the PCCS use to retrieve 
  // verification collateral must support the new 3.1 APIs.

  // If local_pck_url is not defined, set pck_cache_expire_hours to a none-zero value will enable local cache.

  // ===== Important: Once the local cache files are created, currently there is no other way to clean them other
  //                  than to delete them manually, or wait for them to expire after "pck_cache_expire_hours" hours.
  //                  To delete the cache files manually, go to these foders:
  //                       Linux : $AZDCAP_CACHE, $XDG_CACHE_HOME, $HOME, $TMPDIR, /tmp/
  //                       Windows : $AZDCAP_CACHE, $LOCALAPPDATA\..\..\LocalLow
  //                  If there is a folder called .dcap-qcnl, delete it. Restart the service after all cache 
  //                  folders were deleted. The same method applies to "verify_collateral_cache_expire_hours"
