# Intel® Software Guard Extensions and Intel® Trust Domain Extensions Data Center Attestation Primitives (Intel® SGX and Intel® TDX DCAP) Quote Verification Service

## WARNING!
-------
As this branch(feature/QVS) was dedicated to QVS features we announce that it will be no longer supported here. QVS and QVL were moved to submodules as below: 

QVS: https://github.com/intel/SGX-TDX-DCAP-QuoteVerificationService.

QVL: https://github.com/intel/SGX-TDX-DCAP-QuoteVerificationLibrary

## Introduction

Quote Verification Service is a stateless server endpoint implementation that verifies attestation evidence (quote) of ISV (Independent Software Vendor) enclaves.
It can be used as a part of [SGX attestation](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/software-guard-extensions/attestation-services.html) process.

Service checks, that provided evidence comes from a genuine, non-revoked SGX/TDX capable platform on given TCB level and generates appriopriate JSON report. Based on that report and by verifying additional evidences (like: MRSIGNER, MRENCLAVE) client can decide whether to trust this enclave or not. 


## Service architecture overview

![QVS Diagram](diagram.png?raw=true "QVS Diagram")

ISV Quote Verification Backend potential structure is presented on the diagram above. 

Quote Verification Service utilizes [QVL](../QVL) to perform it's business logic. It also communicates with Verification Collateral Distribution Services (PCS and CRL Distribution List) to obtain latest collaterals. When verification is done, report is generated and sent to a crypto provider - Verification Crypto Service (VCS) in order to be signed. 

VCS is a service capable of storing (Secure Key Storage) and using cryptographic keys in a secure manner (for example, by utilizing Hardware Secure Module). It has to be provided and protected by ISV, as a part of it's Quote Verification Backend.
Sample VCS implementation called [Simple Signing Service (SSS)](samples/simple-signing-service/README.md) has been created for demo purposes only - please do NOT use it in production environment.

## System requirements
QVS is purely software component, and it doesn't require SGX capable platform to work. Although it can be additionally protected by running inside an enclave (for example by using [Gramine](https://gramineproject.io/)).
Following instructions were tested using Linux (Ubuntu) distribution.

## Prerequisites for Linux

 - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (tested with version 16.13.1) with `npm` and `cmake-js` addon
 - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (tested with version 20.10.11)
 - install prerequisites from [QVL](../QVL)

#### Install software dependencies
For Ubuntu 18.04, the following command can be used to install all necessary software dependencies:
- Node.js
  - ```$ wget https://nodejs.org/dist/v16.13.1/node-v16.13.1-linux-x64.tar.gz```
  - ```$ sudo tar -C /usr/local --strip-components 1 -xzf node-v16.13.1-linux-x64.tar.gz```
- cmake-js
  - ```$ sudo npm install -g cmake-js``` (assuming Node.js is already installed)
- Docker
  - ```$ curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh```
  - ```$ sudo sh ./get-docker.sh```

## Building on Linux
The build was tested on Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04.
Here, we assume that the [build prerequisites](#prerequisites-for-linux) are fulfilled. 

Execute ```./build.sh```. This script will build QVL, QVS Service and finally will create Docker Image with service installed in it. 

Script will build:
- QVL
- download and install node modules
- copy native libs into service structure
- produce docker image ```qvs:latest```


## Setting up local environment

QVS service can be either [run locally](#running-locally) or [inside a docker container](#running-docker-image).
To set up local environment, a working instance of Verification Crypto Service (VCS) is required.

For non-production/development purpose use mock VCS located in [samples/simple-signing-service](./samples/simple-signing-service/README.md). 
It is recommended to write your own Verification Crypto Service that will be able to securely protect Signing Key for attestation evidence.

By default QVS is using MTLS to communicate with VCS, it is recommended to keep  [QVS_VCS_CLIENT_TLS_CLIENT_TYPE](#service-configuration) set to MTLS.

In order to set up local environment one must generate required key pairs for MTLS. Commands in README files linked in next sections will show how to generate self-signed certificates for non-production environment. It is highly recommended not to use such self-signed certificates in production and replace them with certificates signed by widely trusted certification authority.

### Set-up Simple-Signing-Service:
Go to [samples/simple-signing-service/README.md](samples/simple-signing-service/README.md). Simple-signing-service will provide output with correctly formatted certifcate (see mock-service log and search for: SIGNING_KEY_CERTIFCATE_URL_ENCODED) from Signing Key that needs to be included as env variable QVS_ATTESTATION_REPORT_SIGNING_CERTIFICATE to your Quote Verification Service.

### Configure QVS (MTLS)
Go to [configuration-default/certificates/README.md](configuration-default/certificates/README.md) - (Some of the steps should be already done as a part of SSS instruction)
## Running locally

```bash
QVS_VCS_CLIENT_HOST=localhost QVS_VCS_CLIENT_PORT=8797 QVS_ATTESTATION_REPORT_SIGNING_CERTIFICATE=SIGNING_KEY_CERTIFCATE_URL_ENCODED NODE_ENV=production node src/bootstrap.js
```
## Running docker image

```bash
docker run --network host --env QVS_VCS_CLIENT_HOST=localhost --env QVS_VCS_CLIENT_PORT=8797 --env QVS_ATTESTATION_REPORT_SIGNING_CERTIFICATE=SIGNING_KEY_CERTIFCATE_URL_ENCODED -it qvs:latest
```

## Healtcheck
```bash
curl --cacert ./configuration-default/certificates/qvs-cert.pem https://localhost:8799/health
```
